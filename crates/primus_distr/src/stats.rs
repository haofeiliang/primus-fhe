/// representative is exact in both `i128` and `f64`. A small temporary vector
/// of `ranges.len()` integer limits is allocated once per call. The sample sum
/// is exact: limiting both the modulus and sample count to `2^53` bounds its
/// magnitude below `2^105`, within `i128`.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `samples` — modular values in `[0, modulus)`.
/// - `modulus` — the ring modulus `Q`; the upper half `(Q/2, Q)` is
///   interpreted as negative values.
/// - `sigma` — finite, positive expected standard deviation, used only for the
///   `ranges * sigma` limits.
/// - `ranges` — finite, non-negative sigma multipliers for cumulative counting.
/// - `counts` — output buffer (same length as `ranges`).
///   On return, `counts[i]` = number of samples with
///   `|x_centered| <= ranges[i] * sigma`.
///
/// # Returns
/// `(mean, std_dev)` where `std_dev` is the square root of the
/// population variance.
///
/// # Panics
/// Panics if the output length differs from `ranges.len()`, the modulus is zero
/// or larger than `2^53`, a sample is not in `[0, modulus)`, a floating-point
/// parameter is invalid, the sample count cannot be represented exactly as an
