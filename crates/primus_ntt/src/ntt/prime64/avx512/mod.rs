//! AVX-512 NTT transform kernels translated from Intel HEXL.
//!
//! The stage decomposition deliberately remains close to HEXL's
//! `fwd-ntt-avx512.cpp` and `inv-ntt-avx512.cpp`: transforms up to 1024
//! coefficients are breadth-first, larger transforms recurse depth-first, and
//! the packed T4/T2 forward stages consume the same expanded root layout.
//! This makes arithmetic or range changes reviewable against the upstream
//! implementation.
//!
//! Rust-specific adaptations are kept at the boundaries: transforms are
//! in-place slices, fixed-size chunks replace pointer-counting loops, and table
//! construction supplies `inv_n`. The `_mm512_hexl_*` arithmetic names remain
//! where a one-to-one upstream comparison is useful.
