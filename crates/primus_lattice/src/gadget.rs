//! Shared row-major GGSW/RGSW diagonal traversal.

/// Visits the diagonal polynomial of one decomposition level in every row.
///
/// The caller maintains matching storage and layout lengths from a checked gadget
/// size. `level` must be within that size's decomposition length; the public
/// operation only diagnoses this condition with a debug assertion.
/// `poly_len`, `glwe_len` and `glev_len` count stored elements in the current
/// representation: one polynomial, one GLWE ciphertext and one complete GLev row,
/// respectively. For RGSW, GLWE has dimension one, so these are RLWE and RLev lengths.
/// `ggsw_data` contains the entire GGSW (or RGSW), laid out as
/// `[row][level][component][polynomial entry]`, with as many components as rows.
/// No dimensions are inferred from the backing slice.
